# Train Management Application

## Description

This is a console-based Train Management Application where I practiced Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, exception handling, and metaprogramming. The application also utilizes the `tty-prompt` library to provide a more user-friendly menu interface in the terminal.

## Installation

Ensure you have Ruby installed. Then, install the required gems manually if needed:

```sh
gem install tty-prompt
```

## Running the Application

To start the application, run:

```sh
ruby main.rb
```

## Features

- Object-Oriented design with encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
- Exception handling for better error management.
- Metaprogramming techniques to dynamically define methods and enhance flexibility.
- Interactive terminal menu using `tty-prompt`.

## Usage

The application allows users to:
- Create and manage trains, routes, and stations.
- Assign routes to trains and control train movement.
- View and modify train details through an interactive menu.
